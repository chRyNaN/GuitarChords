/**
 * A model of a rectangle for a Javascript [HTMLCanvasElement].
 *
 * Note that this model considers the origin of the
 * quadrant to be in the top left. So, on the x-axis, the values start at zero at the furthest left point and increase
 * positively when moving to the right. And on the y-axis, the values start at zero at the highest top point and
 * increase positively when moving to the bottom. So the Canvas quadrant that this [Rect] supports would look like the
 * following:
 *
 * (0, 0)                (x, 0)
 *        +------------------>
 *        |
 *        |
 *        |
 *        |
 * (0, y) |
 *
 * This is important to consider because some of the properties depend on it. For instance, the [isEmpty] property will
 * return true if the top is greater than or equal to the bottom).
 *
 * Also note that this [Rect] uses values of [Double] for the four values. This is consistent with what the
 * [CanvasRenderingContext2D.rect] function expects.
 *
 * @property [left] The left coordinate of this [Rect].
 * @property [top] The top coordinate of this [Rect].
 * @property [right] The right coordinate of this [Rect].
 * @property [bottom] The bottom coordinate of this [Rect].
